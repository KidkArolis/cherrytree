# Example: hello world

This is a single file demo of cherrytree. It's a very simple static twitter like app. It's simple to keep the code short and just show how to get started.

    $ npm install
    $ npm start

Now open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

Or open [http://localhost:8000/webpack-dev-server/bundle](http://localhost:8000/webpack-dev-server/bundle) to see the live reloading version of the app.

To compile the app into a single file for production run

    $ npm run bundle
