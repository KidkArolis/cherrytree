        This hook is the first of the route entry validation hooks
        called when an attempt is made to transition into a route
        or one of its children. It is called before `model` and
        `afterModel`, and is appropriate for cases when:

        1) A decision can be made to redirect elsewhere without
           needing to resolve the model first.
        2) Any async operations need to occur first before the
           model is attempted to be resolved.

        This hook is provided the current `transition` attempt
        as a parameter, which can be used to `.abort()` the transition,
        save it for a later `.retry()`, or retrieve values set
        on it from a previous hook. You can also just call
        `this.transitionTo` to another route to implicitly
        abort the `transition`.

        You can return a promise from this hook to pause the
        transition until the promise resolves (or rejects). This could
        be useful, for instance, for retrieving async code from
        the server that is required to enter a route.

        ```js
        var PostRoute = Route.extend({
          beforeModel: function(transition) {
            var post = this.get("posts").first();
            if (!post) {
              this.transitionTo("/somewhere");
            }
          }
        });
        ```

        @method beforeModel
        @param {Transition} transition
        @param {Object} queryParams the active query params for this route
        @return {Promise} if the value returned from this hook is
          a promise, the transition will pause until the transition
          resolves. Otherwise, non-promise return values are not
          utilized in any way.
      */
      beforeModel: noop,

      /**
        A hook you can implement to convert the URL into the context for
        this route.

        ```js
        Router.map(function() {
          this.resource('post', {path: '/posts/:post_id'});
        });
        ```

        This hook follows the asynchronous/promise semantics
        described in the documentation for `beforeModel`. In particular,
        if a promise returned from `model` fails, the error will be
        handled by the `error` hook unless you `catch` the failed promise
        and handle the error locally.

        Example

        ```js
        PostRoute = Route.extend({
          model: function(params) {
            return Post.find(params.post_id).then(function (post) {
              return {
                post: post
              };
            });
          }
        });
        ```

        Notice how we return an object with key `post` - that's because
        we want to name the model. This way the child routes can access this
        model by calling `this.get("post")`.

        @method model
        @param {Object} params the parameters extracted from the URL
        @param {Transition} transition
        @param {Object} queryParams the query params for this route
        @return {Object|Promise} the context for this route. If
          a promise is returned, the transition will pause until
          the promise resolves, and the resolved value of the promise
          will be used as the context for this route.
      */
      model: noop,
      
      /**
        This hook is called after this route's model has resolved.
        It follows identical async/promise semantics to `beforeModel`
        but is provided the route's resolved context in addition to
        the `transition`, and is therefore suited to performing
        logic that can only take place after the model has already
        resolved.

        ```js
        PostsRoute = Route.extend({
          afterModel: function(posts, transition) {
            if (posts.length === 1) {
              this.transitionTo('post.show', posts[0]);
            }
          }
        });
        ```

        Refer to documentation for `beforeModel` for a description
        of transition-pausing semantics when a promise is returned
        from this hook.

        @method afterModel
        @param {Object} resolvedContext the value returned from `model`,
          or its resolved value if it was a promise
        @param {Transition} transition
        @param {Object} queryParams the active query params for this handler
        @return {Promise} if the value returned from this hook is
          a promise, the transition will pause until the transition
          resolves. Otherwise, non-promise return values are not
          utilized in any way.
